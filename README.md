# Taxon-based_FunSpe
This repository contains the data and code script for estimating taxon-based functional specificity index.  


**Data in this repository:**  
 - Community composition (ASV table) of prokaryotes. The sampling coverage of samples was standardized using the coverage-based approach (Chao et al., 2014).  
 - An ecosystem function related to the utilization of Glucose-1-phosphate (Biolog EcoPlate, Hayward, CA, USA).
 
**Script in this repository:**  
 - masenet.new.R  (please run this code before running Taxon-based_FunSpe.R)
 - Taxon-based_FunSpe.R  

 
Detailed explanations for data preparation and script were described in https://academic.oup.com/femsec/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/femsec/fiac058/6585974?redirectedFrom=fulltext
